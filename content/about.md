![Arthurs Seat (Edinburgh)](/img/arthurs_seat.jpg "Well, that's me! *(Edinburgh June 2025)*")

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in **DevOps & Backend Development** with **7+ years of experience** building web applications and the infrastructure that powers them.

In my current position I'm bridging the gap between data science, software development, and operations - automating workflows, designing scalable systems, and solving complex technical challenges in constrained environments.

## Currently Working On

- Rebuilding my homelab infrastructure with Proxmox and OpenTofu
- Writing guides on infrastructure automation and DevOps practices
- Deepening expertise in Kubernetes and GitOps workflows

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me mountaineering or bouldering, improving my problem solving skills. I'm also a hobbyist photographer with an eye for detail and - in case you didn't notice yet - a passionate Homelabber.
