## Introduction

**First of all:** Welcome to my brand new homelab blog!

This is not only the start of an article series on **How to start a blog (2025)**, it is also the very first post on my blog. So please be kind, I never did that before!

### Why (yet another) homelab blog?

Actually there are quite a few reasons:

- A few months ago a close friend of mine told me she was going to start an animal welfare association and wanted me to help her launch a website. So what could be a better motivation to check out some CMS software than **helping puppies**? :dog:
- While there are already many pretty awesome blogs in the homelab community, I always had the feeling that they often **only show you the basic stuff** and leave you alone when it comes to the more interesting problems. For example there are countless tutorials on how to set up a reverse proxy and use let's encrypt to get valid certificates for your internal services, but there is basically nothing on how to use the very same technology to get certificates for LDAPS.
- Ever had to pause on a project for a few weeks or even months and found some pretty weird config settings you had absolutely no clue about anymore? Been there, done that. There were just too many times I couldn't for the life of me remember why I chose to set up the service the way I did. So this blog hopefully will also serve me as a **documentation of my homelab** in case of desaster recovery.

That's why I decided to start this blog and provide an article series about how to start a homelab from scratch. Starting with the install of the hypervisor and going through parts like adding reverse proxies, authentication and monitoring services while also paying attention to coding best practices like linting or security checks along our way.

### What this tutorial covers

In this tutorial we will set up a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) project, configure the look of your new blog, add some very first content and host the website using GitHub pages.

### A few words on Hugo

TODO

## Pre-Requisites

So what will you need to follow along with this tutorial? Actually not that much!

- **the code editor of your choice:** I'm using VS Code with the WSL plugin here but use whatever editor you are comfortable with.
- **a GitHub account:** Well, that one most of you will already have anyways and in case you don't, it shouldn't be too challenging.
- **a registered domain:** *(optional)* While this one is not really necessary to follow along, I would really recommend you to get one. It's not as expensive as you might think (I'm paying 24 â‚¬ a year for this one) and makes your blog look way more professional.
- **a cup of *whatever your favorite hot drink is*:** Yep, already quite cold outside here in Germany.

## Next steps

So what's next? As stated in the beginning, this is supposed to be an article series. In the next posts I want to go through some more advanced topics like adding support for multiple languages or adding a CMS like Decap CMS to your blog.
